Sourceduty doesn't work directly in filmmaking but it can create innovative concept ideas for movies. These ideas offer a foundation that filmmakers and storytellers can develop and bring to life on screen. Alex Aldridge likes to imagine and design these initial concepts as a source of inspiration for those in the film industry looking to tell new and engaging stories.

1. The scene starts with a low angle neorealistic close-up following everyday people walking on a city sidewalk. The inital camera is full-screen and wide angle. 

2. The camera slowly rises to eye level and zooms in on the main character walking by himself on the sidewalk. 

3. As the camera rises there is a **transition from the full-screen and wide angle aspect ratio to a letter-boxed aspect ratio.**
